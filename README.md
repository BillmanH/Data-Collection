# king_county_data
API services and Ipython notebooks to get and analyze data from http://info.kingcounty.gov/

# Look through housing prices in King County;
You can search through the map here:
http://gismaps.kingcounty.gov/parcelviewer2/
-find your building's parcel number (or a list of them)
-Then this script will extract the historic property value data
-You can pull this also for all of the individual units in a condo
which is what I wanted as I planned on compareing my value to similar units

Eventually I'll have this flushed out into a web app and more robust libary
I just wanted to get it started here.
